# An Insight into the Apps in the Google Play Store

## INTRODUCTION:

The ubiquitous usage of apps help individuals and businesses unlock extraordinary opportunities and reach their outcomes faster. The App market has been evolving rapidly for over a decade. While both the Google Play Store and the iTunes App Store platforms satisfy the same user needs, I will be exploring the Google Play Store App dataset to find out why users download Google Store apps in a given category.

## INSPIRATION :

I encountered difficulties in downloading apps from the iTunes App store which made me choose Android. I discovered that the apps in the Google Play Store were convenient, user-friendly, and categorized according to different user needs. This grew me curious in exploring the variety of features in the Google Play Store.

Examine the performance of the different app features and analyze user engagement metrics in the Google Play Store.

## Questions to Explore:

1. What are the most popular app categories in the Google Play Store?
2. What is the most common app Type among users?
3. How does user Reviews impact app downloads in the Google Play Store?
